CLI flow

1. ⚽  English Poetry Corpus Generator requires you to pass in a flag indicating how many poems you want to return.
       Additional flags will indicate whether you want to read the poems in your terminal (for pleasure), or
       simply output json to be consume into another application.
    Run with --help for help.
2. Scrape and instantiate the number of poems passed in
3. If the second flag said consume
    - output json of the form
    - poems => [
        {title: },
        {author: },
        {text: }
    ]
3. If the second flag said read for pleasure
puts "How would you like to discover poems?"
puts "List poems"
puts "List poet"
